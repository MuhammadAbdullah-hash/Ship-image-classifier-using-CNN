Data is pretty big.!
By calling Kaggle's API " kaggle datasets download -d arpitjain007/game-of-deep-learning-ship-datasets "
Down load following files 

train.zip 
test_ApKoW4T.csv
sample_submission_ns2btKE.csv

After uploading files the code will UNZIP them in "Sample_data" folder of colab. Drag and drop them outside of that forlder.
With that done you are set to go !
