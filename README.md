# Ship-image-classifier-using-Convolutional Neural Network. (CNN)
Doing a computer vision or image classification tasks Convolutional networks comes in handy. They use technique call FEATURE-EXTRACTION to break down the image and learn its different aspects in detail. 
I have used a KAGGLE compitition data set which contains 8000 images of ships from 5 categories. 6256 are training images and rest of them are testing images.IN programme Images are preprocessed and resized in a numpy array and then fed to neural CNN. I have used 4 convolutional layer as it gives maximum accuracy. Labels are also hot encoded to match training and testing image shapes. Different categories of ships are as follows :

1: Cargo  

2: Military

3: Carrier

4: Cruise

5: Tankers
