# Ship-image-classifier-using-Convolutional Neural Network. (CNN)
Doing a computer vision or image classification tasks Convolutional networks comes in handy. They use technique call FEATURE-EXTRACTION to break down the image and learn its different aspects in detail. 
I have used a KAGGLE compitition data set which contains 8000 images of ships from 5 categories 

1: Cargo  
2: Military
3: Carrier
4: Cruise
5: Tankers
